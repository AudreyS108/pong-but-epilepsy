# Pong But Epilepsy

This project is called Pong But Epilepsy.   
It is my (third/fourth) submission for Hack Club's Athena Award.   
As the name suggests, this project is designed to be a chaotic pong game with a variety of wacky features. 
Play the game to find out how it works, but be warned that there will be some epilepsy-inducing elements!
