# Pong But Epilepsy

This project is called Pong But Epilepsy.   
It is my (third/fourth) submission for Hack Club's Athena Award.   
As the name suggests, this project is designed to be a chaotic pong game with a variety of wacky features. 
Play the game to find out how it works, but be warned that there will be some epilepsy-inducing elements!

Why did I make this project?

__________________________________________________________
This project was made by using the language Python and Python libraries/modules PyGame, Sys and Random.
* Python: The coding language used to make this project.   
* PyGame: The primary Python Library used for this project. This library helped in creating the main structure of the pong game. It allowed for me to display various sprites on the game's screen, as well as creating physics for the objects created.  
* Sys (System): Python module used for interacting with Python runtime environment. Also helped in debugging the code.
* Random: The Python module used for areas involving randomising. In my project, I used it to generate random RGB colors to contribute the "epilepsy" effect in my game.
