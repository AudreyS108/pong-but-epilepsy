# Pong But Epilepsy

This project is called Pong But Epilepsy.   
It is my (third/fourth) submission for Hack Club's Athena Award.   
As the name suggests, this project is designed to be a chaotic pong game with a variety of wacky features. 
Play the game to find out how it works, but be warned that there will be some epilepsy-inducing elements!

Personal Project Evaluation and Reflection
-
I decided to make this project for a fun technology week competition at my school. The theme of the competition was "chaos". Since my projects weren't usually silly, I was sort of stumped on what to do. Eventually, a friend of mine (also participating in the game competition) suggested to give the viewer epilepsy by switching the background colors constantly and by using a wide range of sounds. Genius. Because of this, I decided to create a simple pong game, but with an epilepsy factor. Simple, yet absolutely wacky. Also, I recently learned how to create games using Pygame, so I used it to make my project. Due to the limited time participants had to create their games for the competition, I only managed to add the main epilepsy factor and working pong game elements. At some point after the competition, I found the unfinished game sitting in my computer files. So, I chose to complete it and present the complete version of Pong But Epilepsy, which included a functional game menu and toggles.

This project was made by using the language Python and Python libraries/modules PyGame, Sys and Random.
* Python: The coding language used to make this project.   
* PyGame: The primary Python Library used for this project. This library helped in creating the main structure of the pong game. It allowed for me to display various sprites on the game's screen, as well as creating physics for the objects created.  
* Sys (System): Python module used for interacting with Python runtime environment. Also helped in debugging the code.
* Random: The Python module used for areas involving randomising. In my project, I used it to generate random RGB colors to contribute the "epilepsy" effect in my game.
