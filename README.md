# Pong But Epilepsy

This project is called Pong But Epilepsy.   
It is my (third/fourth) submission for Hack Club's Athena Award.   
As the name suggests, this project is designed to be a chaotic pong game with a variety of wacky features. 
Play the game to find out how it works, but be warned that there will be some epilepsy-inducing elements!

This Python project is a fun game featuring many different technical elements and game modes. Here's a breakdown of the game:

Personal Project Evaluation and Reflection
-
I decided to make this project for a fun technology week competition at my school. The theme of the competition was "chaos". Since my projects weren't usually silly, I was sort of stumped on what to do. Eventually, a friend of mine (also participating in the game competition) suggested to give the viewer epilepsy by switching the background colors constantly and by using a wide range of sounds. Genius. Because of this, I decided to create a simple pong game, but with an epilepsy factor. Simple, yet absolutely wacky. Also, I recently learned how to create games using Pygame, so I used it to make my project. Due to the limited time participants had to create their games for the competition, I only managed to add the main epilepsy factor and working pong game elements. At some point after the competition, I found the unfinished game sitting in my computer files. So, I chose to complete it and present the complete version of Pong But Epilepsy, which included a functional game menu and toggles.

This project was made by using the language Python and Python libraries/modules PyGame, Sys and Random.
* Python: The coding language used to make this project.   
* PyGame: The primary Python Library used for this project. This library helped in creating the main structure of the pong game. It allowed for me to display various sprites on the game's screen, as well as creating physics for the objects created.  
* Sys (System): Python module used for interacting with Python runtime environment. Also helped in debugging the code.
* Random: The Python module used for areas involving randomising. In my project, I used it to generate random RGB colors to contribute the "epilepsy" effect in my game. Also, I used the "random.choice" function to set random speeds for the ball with each rebound, just to make it extra chaotic and unpredictable!

While making this project, I was faced with different challenges.   
* Challenge 1: Creating the physics of the game elements: paddles and balls. This was probably one of the most difficult parts of the project. Pygame doesn't come with its own physics, unlike other game development platforms such as Unity. I used some if/else loops to let the ball change direction when certain criteria (e.g. if the top of the ball touches the top of the screen) was met. 
* Challenge 2:
